Subject: Following up - {{business_name}}

Hi again,

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about {{business_name}}.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short - if you're interested in chatting about improving your online presence, I'd be happy to set up a quick call at your convenience.

If not, no worries at all. I won't reach out again.

Best,
